# Leveraging Telecom Churn Analysis for Strategic Decision-Making

## Problem Statement

The project "Leveraging Telecom Churn Analysis for Strategic Decision-Making" addresses the critical issue of customer churn in the telecom industry. By analyzing a dataset comprising 3333 customer entries, the study identifies a churn rate of 14.49%, highlighting the need for targeted customer retention strategies. Visualization of churn distribution underscores an imbalance, necessitating focused interventions for at-risk segments. A correlation matrix reveals significant relationships among features, guiding feature engineering and resource allocation. Predictive models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting achieve accuracies up to 94% and ROC AUC scores exceeding 0.83, indicating their robustness in identifying potential churners. Feature importance analysis identifies DayMins, MonthlyCharge, and CustServCalls as top predictors, suggesting areas for service enhancements and personalized retention efforts. This comprehensive analysis empowers telecom providers to reduce churn rates, optimize marketing campaigns, and enhance customer satisfaction, driving sustainable growth and profitability.

Loading and examining the dataset reveals it contains 3333 entries and 11 columns, with no missing values, simplifying preprocessing efforts. The basic statistics provide an overview of the data's distribution and central tendencies. Visualizations illustrate the imbalance in the churn data, emphasizing the need for strategies to address this issue. A heatmap of the correlation matrix highlights critical relationships between features, essential for effective feature selection and engineering. This foundational analysis sets the stage for building and evaluating predictive models, ensuring a data-driven approach to tackling churn.

The project evaluates three classification models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. The models' performance metrics, including precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC, reveal that Gradient Boosting outperforms the others with the highest accuracy and ROC AUC score. Feature importance analysis from the Random Forest model pinpoints DayMins, MonthlyCharge, and CustServCalls as the most significant predictors of churn. These insights enable telecom providers to prioritize service improvements and develop personalized retention strategies. By leveraging these findings, telecom companies can proactively reduce churn rates, enhance customer satisfaction, and achieve long-term business success.
